Fruits are important sources of vitamins and carbohydrates like fiber and sugar.They are low in calories and naturally sweet.<br>
Fruits nd their juices are good source of water too...mangoes,papayas,melons and citries fruits,like oranges and grapefruits are high in vitamin c.<br>Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.[1] Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.
